## Python CloudSQL Query Library for Google App Engine

A demonstration on how to use appengine for building a geospatial application 
based on [CloudSQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs). This appengine 
application implements the backend server that your Google Maps API application 
can use to query your geospatial data.

## Run Locally
1. Install the [App Engine Python SDK](https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads).
See the README file for directions. You'll need python 2.7 and [pip 1.4 or later](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html) installed too.

2. Install dependencies in the project's lib directory.
   Note: App Engine can only import libraries from inside your project directory.

   ```
   cd project-wander-api
   pip install -r requirements.txt -t lib
   ```
3. Run this project locally from the command line:

   ```
   dev_appserver.py .
   ```

Visit the application [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

See [the development server documentation](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/devserver)
for options when running dev_appserver.

## Deploy
To deploy the application:

1. Use the [Admin Console](https://appengine.google.com) to create a
   project/app id. (App id and project id are identical)
1. [Deploy the
   application](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/uploadinganapp) with

   ```
   appcfg.py -A <your-project-id> --oauth2 update .
   ```
1. Congratulations!  Your application is now live at your-app-id.appspot.com

## Next Steps
This skeleton includes `TODO` markers to help you find basic areas you will want
to customize.

### Installing Libraries
See the [Third party
libraries](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/libraries27)
page for libraries that are already included in the SDK.  To include SDK
libraries, add them in your app.yaml file. Other than libraries included in
the SDK, only pure python libraries may be added to an App Engine project.
